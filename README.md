<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Eslorex</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a passionate Game Developer from Turkey and I study Computer Sciences (3rd grade). </h3>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Illusa VR Game**
- Generally, I prefer to prioritize learning through engagement in larger projects rather than focusing on several smaller ones. Illusa serves as a prime example of this approach. I challenged myself by immersing into a project that was riddled with numerous problems, enabling me to learn how to solve them one by one. 

- When I and my classmates started developing Illusa during the 3rd grade, I already possessed some programming knowledge, but I wanted to delve deeper into the game development industry. As a VR user for the past five years, I wanted to push myself and my team to tackle more complex programming by deciding to develop a VR game from scratch. This decision proved to be highly beneficial as it enabled us to enhance our skills and passion in a short period. We started learning various skills from start, such as 3D modeling, animation, VR-based physics, and developing AI characters that operate independently of navmesh.

- Our plan is to launch Illusa exclusively for Steam and PCVR within the next 1-2 years. We have been fortunate to receive assistance from a select few exceptional individuals who have supported us without any expectation of reward. Without their contributions, it's possible that Illusa concept would not exist today.

- Also I place great value on maintaining my anonymity because my government hasn't been able to ensure safety of their peoples personal information. It's possible to obtain a person's complete identity information, their address etc. for less than a dollar.

- **My Github Repositories**
- Typically, I share repositories that contain algorithms or small projects I have created to assist people online or for my school. It's important to keep in mind that I may not prioritize code quality or design, particularly if the project doesn't pertain to game development. 
- Also I create distinct repositories for each algorithm as it can be challenging to locate the explanation or application of the algorithm within the same folder.
- My experience extends beyond what I have shared on Github. I conduct numerous experiments with Unity, but I typically don't share them.

- **About experienced tools and languages**
- Most of the tools and languages that are below are at least once were introduced to me during my time at university or when I was curious enough to use them. I possess the most experience in **C#**, After Effects, **Photoshop**, **Unity**, **Git** and **Blender**. Which are primarily associated with game development, as you may have guessed.

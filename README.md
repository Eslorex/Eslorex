<h3 align="center">Hi! I'm Eslorex, a passionate Computer Engineer & Unreal Engine Game Developer </h3>

- **My Github Repositories**
- Typically, I share repositories that contain algorithms or small projects I have created to assist people online or for my school. It's important to keep in mind that I may not prioritize code quality or design, particularly if the project doesn't pertain to game development. 
- Also I create distinct repositories for each algorithm as it can be challenging to locate the explanation or application of the algorithm within the same folder. I might merge them into one folder with documentation one day. Since I think they're too simple to have their own repository. 
- My experience extends beyond what I have shared on Github. I conduct numerous experiments with Unreal Engine and Unity, but I typically don't share them.

- **About experienced tools and languages**
- Most of the tools and languages that are below are at least once were introduced to me during my time at university or when I was curious enough to use them. I possess the most experience in **C#**, After Effects, **Photoshop**, **Unity**, **Git** and **Blender**. Which are primarily associated with game development, as you may have guessed.
